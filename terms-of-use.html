                <p>Welcome to use Ro Charging - Animation Effect!</p>

                <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
                    therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify
                    the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract
                    the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or
                    make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and
                    other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Behzat Kasten.</p>

                <p>Behzat Kasten is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
                    reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
                    and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                    clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                </p>

                <p>With respect to Behzat Kasten’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app,
                    it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct
                    at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it
                    available to you. Behzat Kasten accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
                    experience
                    as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

                <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the
                    requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
                    app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Liam
                    Bennett does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
                    works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                    accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app,
                    and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell
                    you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will
                    end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
                    Changes to This Terms and Conditions</p>
